# MetaWeather

MetaWeather helps you get ready for the day or the next 6 days by displaying weather data from
[MetaWeather](https\:www.metaweather.com).

MetaWeather lists data starting with the expected minimum temperature, expected temperature, expected max temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air pressure, humidity, and visibility. 
## Installation

Or install it yourself as:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
